We are happy to have you as a part of the Developer Student Club community. Since our main goal is to create a safe, healthy, and fun peer-to-peer learning community for everyone, a few ground rules are necessary. These guidelines cover both online (e.g. mailing lists, social channels) and offline (e.g. in-person meetups) behavior.

Violations of this code of conduct can result in members being removed from the program. Use your best judgement, and if you’d like more clarity or have questions feel free to reach out. 

**Follow the UT Dallas Student Code of Conduct.** Your activity on the server falls under rules defined within the student code of conduct.

**Use your real name on the Discord server.** This means that either your nickname or your global Discord username must be your real name. Don't impersonate other people, including other people that may not be on the server.

**Be nice. We're all part of the same community, so be friendly, welcoming, and generally a nice person.** Be someone that other people want to be around. No NSFW content.

**Be respectful and constructive.** Remember to be respectful and constructive with your communication to fellow members. Don't get into flame wars, make personal attacks, vent, or rant unconstructively. Everyone should take responsibility for the community and take the initiative to diffuse tension and stop a negative thread as early as possible.

**Basic etiquette for online discussions.** Don’t send messages to a big list that only needs to go to one person. Keep off topic conversations to a minimum. Don’t be spammy by advertising or promoting personal projects which are off topic.

**Be collaborative.** Work together! We can learn a lot from each other. Share knowledge, and help each other out.

**Participate.** Join in on discussions, show up for in-person meetings regularly, offer feedback, and help implement that feedback.

**By reacting to this message with ${emoji}, you agree to these rules and promise to follow them on the server. You must agree to these to be granted access to the server.**
