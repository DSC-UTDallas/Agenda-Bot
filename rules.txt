We are happy to have you as a part of the Developer Student Club community. Since our main goal is to create a safe, healthy, and fun peer-to-peer learning community for everyone, a few ground rules are necessary. These guidelines cover both online (e.g. mailing lists, social channels) and offline (e.g. in-person meetups) behavior.

**Follow the UT Dallas Student Code of Conduct.** Your activity on the server falls under rules defined within the student code of conduct. Violations of this student code of conduct will be escalated to the University of Texas, Dallas for final decision/actions to be taken.

**Use your real name on the Discord server.** This means that either your nickname or your global Discord username must be your real name. Don't impersonate other people, including other people that may not be on the server.

**Be nice.** We're all part of the same community, so be friendly, welcoming, and generally a nice person. Don‚Äôt make others feel uncomfortable or be threatened. No NSFW content.

**Be respectful and constructive.** Remember to be respectful and constructive with your communication to fellow members. Don't get into flame wars, make personal attacks, vent, or rant unconstructively. Everyone should take responsibility for the community and take the initiative to diffuse tension and stop a negative thread as early as possible. 

**Basic etiquette for online discussions.** Be civil and constructive in all discussion. Don‚Äôt send messages to a big list that only needs to go to one person. Keep off topic conversations to a minimum. Don‚Äôt be spammy by advertising or promoting personal projects which are off topic.

**Be collaborative.** Work together! We can learn a lot from each other. Share knowledge, and help each other out.

**Participate.** Join in on discussions, offer feedback, and help implement that feedback.

Violations of this code of conduct can result in having your membership revoked and being removed from all platforms of our community. If you have any questions or needs clarification, please reach out to one of our Officers. 

If you have already filled out any of our mailing list, you acknowledge that your provided email and information will be used for communication within the community and necessary validation to help construct a safe and healthy peer-to-peer learning environment. 

If you‚Äôd like to report a violation of the rules, you can either DM any of the officers or file it at: https://forms.gle/wWfgPcxtuQ1HwRTv9 (If you have trouble with the form, please DM our officers)
